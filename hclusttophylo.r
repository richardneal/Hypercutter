# traverseTree  \
#------------------------------------------------
# Summary: Recursively travels through the tree contain in a hClust object in order to convert it into XML format. The inital functioncall will start at the root of the
#          tree, and each recursive call works on a subtree.
# 
# ARGS:    Merge:               Details the actual structure of the tree. It is a n-1 x 2 matrix. (n is the number of chunks)
#                               Each row of the matrix documents a merge of two observations or groups
#                               of already merged observations. The numbers in the
#                               two columns detail what was merged. A negative number refers to a single
#                               observation with the number of that observation being the negative's inverse. A
#                               positive number refers to the outcome of the row which index is that number.
#                               This should be taken directly from component with same name contained in hClust object.
#
#          Height:              Gives the length of the branches. It is an array and an element
#                               at index i corrosponds to the length of the branch formed on row i of
#                               the merge table This should be taken directly from component with same name contained in hClust object.
#
#          Labels:              Gives the names of the observations.
#                               This should be taken directly from component with same name contained in hClust object.
#
#          Indent:              Keeps track of the current level of indentation. Any output will be
#                               preceded by indent tabs. When the function is first called indent
#                               should equal 0.
#
#          i:                   The row of merge currently being worked on.
#                               When traverseTree is first called i should equal the index of the last
#                               row in the Merge matrix.
#
#          previousHeight:      The height of the clade that is the parent to the current clade.
#                               It is used to calculate the length of the branch connecting the two. When this function is first called
#                               It should equal the maximum height of the entire dendrogram.
#
#          scalingFactor:       Is a number that all branch lengths are divided by to
#                               prevent bugs that occur when the branch lengths get too high in comparision to the size of the canvas being drawn on.
#                               See the hClustToXML function above for calculation details.
#
#	   id:                  A integer used to uniquely identify the intersections of the
#	                        branches when in annotationMode. Should no matter what the inital value entered is but for best results let the inital value equal 1
#
#          AnnotationMode:      A boolean keeping track of whether the output should contain the necessary skeleton to add annotations. If true
#	                        the output will contain it, if false it won't
#
# RETURNS: The function returns a list containing two elements. The first is a string containing the current subtree in XML format. The second is the current id number, which is used
#          to ensure no id number is repeated.
