Preliminary To-Do List
----------------------

Richard:

1. Add diviText's merged tsv functionality.

Scott:

1. Add additional scrubber features.

I'm positive I'm forgetting some things, so if you remember anything else, please add it.

Finished Features
-----------------

- Unique Sessions

Bugs / Issues
-------------

- The zip file sometimes doesn't get properly overwritten.
- Should the shift size be subtracted from the chunk size? That doesn't really make sense to me.
- I started adding a checkbox for lowercase, but I started messing everything up when I tried to make it checked by default, so maybe you can show me how with the way you're setting the session data?
