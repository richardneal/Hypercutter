Hypercutter
===========

Preliminary To-Do List
----------------------

Richard:


Scott:

1. Add additional scrubber features.

I'm positive I'm forgetting some things, so if you remember anything else, please add it.

Finished Features
-----------------

- Unique Sessions
- Cut by Number of Chunks
- Merged TSV Generation
- Dendogram Generation

Bugs / Issues
-------------

- The zip file sometimes doesn't get properly overwritten.
- I started adding a checkbox for lowercase, but I started messing everything up when I tried to make it checked by default, so maybe you can show me how with the way you're setting the session data?
- There are some lingering problems with user sessions.
- A few treeView options aren't working right now because I haven't put all the code there.
- We need to find a way to clear files even if the user doesn't hit start over. I'm worried that what we have now might even delete things other users are currently using.
